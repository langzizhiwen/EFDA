# Exploratory Functional Data Analysis

This project involves of different tools to analyze and visualized functional data at the first step. It is able to provide functional mean/median curve estimation, curve ranking results, functional outlier detection, robust functional data classification and clustering.
* Functional Boxplot
* Magnitude-Shape PLOT (MSplot)
* Directional Outlyingness
* Functional Boxplot for multivariate curves/trajectories
